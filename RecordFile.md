It is important to find the fix conditions in circle.R D L U is the fix conditions here.

# Remove Elements in LinkList 2022-03-26 23:18
Recycle space is important. Virtual head is useful. if you don not use Virtual head, different handle methods are needed.

# Design Linklist and implement six interfaces. 2022-03-27 22:13
Use index smartly. You can see "ps:" in the file.

# Remove Nth element from end 2022-03-28 18:04
You can find (length - n + 1)th element or use slow and fast pointers to find the pre-Node of the target.

# Detect Cycle 2022-03-29 22:18
Review short circuit, and use it avoid errors. Three problems you should understand,one is that fast pointer and slow pointer must meet if there is a cycle, another is that fast pointer must catch up with slow one in one cycle in the cycle, the last one is that (Head ~ EntryPos) equals with (MeetPos ~ Entry).

It is very important to change direction immediatelly.

# fourSum 2022-04-04 22:58
It is the problem  mainly about data length.

# reverse String 2022-04-05 21:58
You can code some wheels sometimes.

# reverse String II 2022-04-06 21:40
Using a for statement smartly.2k is the scope of a circle.

# reverse words 2022-04-07 23:05
Spend a lot time here and mainly spending on removing extra blanks.

# strStr 2022-04-08 23:41
KMP.

# repeatedSubStringPattern 2022-04-09 22:38
next array 

# MyQueue 2022-04-10 22:26
Use interface more proficient.

# MyStack 2022-04-11 17:40
create a stack with two queues.


# isValid 2022-04-11 19:00
Use stack to slove sysmatric matching problems.

# evalRPN 2022-04-12 22:06
stack.

# maxSlideWindow 2022-04-13 21:02
Use a customized queue to improve a O(k****n) program.

# top k frequence 2022-04-14 20:08
needed to be reviewed.

# trap 2022-04-15 22:07
The end of chapter 7.

# preOrderOfATree 2022-04-16 22:04
the preOrderOfATree.

# inOrderTravleSal 2022-04-17 19:02
the inOrderTravleSal.

# postOrderTravelSal 2022-04-18 18:56
Use a stack to impliment it. 

# levelOrderTravle 2022-04-19 23:12
Implement it with queue.

# invert Tree 2022-04-20 18:08
Exercise it.

# isSymmetric 2022-04-21 23:24
Recurve and iterative

# maxTreeDepth 2022-04-22 20:08
recurve and iterative.

# minTreeDepth 2022-04-22 22:34
recurve and iterative. recurve method is something different from that in maxTreeDepth.

# is Balanced tree 2022-04-23 23:18
You can do this work in the morning dear. Here you meet the backforth first time, you should review them tomorrow.

# all paths in a binary tree. 2022-04-24 23:16
The show of backforth, it is a sophisticated thought.

# has path Sum  2022-04-25 22:12
Iterative and recurve method.

# pathSum 2022-04-26 18:29
Output all path that meet the sum of the target of the tree.

# buildTree 2022-04-27 21:28
Needed to review it.


# buildTree II 2022-04-28 18:40
The same as last one, it is that how to separite the treevecs matters.

# mergeTree 2022-04-29 22:46
Improve the printTree. Nice job.

# searchBST 2022-04-30 21:34
The parameter passed like a new value. It is a local value, When the function completed, the value is dertroied.

# isValidBST 2022-05-01 20:45
It is ordered that the InOrder Traversal of the BST is useful thought here.

# getMinimumDifference 2022-05-02 22:39
Get the minimum value through recorde the previous node is the best one. You still need some time to get the iterative method.

# findMode 2022-05-03 12:25
You can write a lead article to make sure you get it.

# lowestCOmmonAncestor 2022-05-04 22:33
Not so easy one.

# lowestCOmmonAncestor BST 2022-05-05 21:40
a clear thought.

# insertIntoBST 2022-05-06 23:28
A recursive method and an iterative one. 

# delete Node in BST 2022-05-07 21:03
You should review it 

# trimBST 2022-05-08 22:32
delete the node out of given range.

# sorted array to BST 2022-05-09 22:15
This is the last one in this chapter.

# combine 2022-05-10 23:13
This the first one in backtracking.

# lettersCombinations 2022-05-12 22:16
Get a little more about backtrack.

# combinationSum 2022-05-13 22:04
Get the backtrack more, Apply yourself.

# combinationSum2 2022-05-14 23:56
Keep the result unrepeatable using vector<bool> type.

# partition 2022-05-15 23:16
You needed to review it. It also can use the backtracking mode.

# restore IP Adresses 2022-05-16 23:39
It is more like a logic problem, and it Use backtracking to slove it.

# subSet 2022-05-17 23:01
A sub set exercise.

# sub set with duplicated values 2022-05-18 22:18
Yes.

# findSubSequences 2022-05-19 22:29
a new trick to remove the duplicated one vertically.
