# Detect Cycle 2022-03-29 22:18
Review short circuit, and use it avoid errors. Three problems you should understand,one is that fast pointer and slow pointer must meet if there is a cycle, another is that fast pointer must catch up with slow one in one cycle in the cycle, the last one is that (Head ~ EntryPos) equals with (MeetPos ~ Entry).
