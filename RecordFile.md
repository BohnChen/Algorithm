# Algorithm
Record my footsteps on the path of algorithm

# Reverse LinkList
Review the Linklist operation, including inserting elements from rear.

# Binary Search 
[left, right] and [left, right) are absolutely different version.

# Remove Element 2022-03-23
slowIndex marks the position need to be replace, fastIndex marks the position will replace the slow one.

# Find Minimum  Sub Array Length 2022-03-24 23:05
Using Slide window to find it, remember that it is a serias of elements in a row.

# Spiral Matrix 2022-03-25 22:51
It is important to find the fix conditions in circle.R D L U is the fix conditions here.

# Remove Elements in LinkList 2022-03-26 23:18
Recycle space is important. Virtual head is useful. if you don not use Virtual head, different handle methods are needed.

# Design Linklist and implement six interfaces. 2022-03-27 22:13
Use index smartly. You can see "ps:" in the file.

# Remove Nth element from end 2022-03-28 18:04
You can find (length - n + 1)th element or use slow and fast pointers to find the pre-Node of the target.

# Detect Cycle 2022-03-29 22:18
Review short circuit, and use it avoid errors. Three problems you should understand,one is that fast pointer and slow pointer must meet if there is a cycle, another is that fast pointer must catch up with slow one in one cycle in the cycle, the last one is that (Head ~ EntryPos) equals with (MeetPos ~ Entry).

# Valid Anagram 2022-03-30 18:16
bitmap. it is an easy problem. You can improve your program to operate on one array.

# InterSection 2022-03-31 23:00
set and multiset use RB-tree, unordered_set use hash.Exercise using methods.

# TwoSum 2022-04-01 22:08
A comparision for different method using different data structure.

# fourSum II 2022-04-02 22:22
It is important to rule the meaning of key and value 

# threeSum 2022-04-03 21:37
It is very important to change direction immediatelly.

# fourSum 2022-04-04 22:58
It is the problem  mainly about data length.

# reverse String 2022-04-05 21:58
You can code some wheels sometimes.

# reverse String II 2022-04-06 21:40
Using a for statement smartly.2k is the scope of a circle.

# reverse words 2022-04-07 23:05
Spend a lot time here and mainly spending on removing extra blanks.

# strStr 2022-04-08 23:41
KMP.

# repeatedSubStringPattern 2022-04-09 22:38
next array 

# MyQueue 2022-04-10 22:26
Use interface more proficient.

# MyStack 2022-04-11 17:40
create a stack with two queues.


# isValid 2022-04-11 19:00
Use stack to slove sysmatric matching problems.

# evalRPN 2022-04-12 22:06
stack.
